# Project Title

Medicine Timetable App

# Problem Statement

People sometimes forget the timings of their medicines, especially if they have multiple medicines in a day. This can cause confusion and lead to missed doses. There should be a simple way to store all medicines and their timings in one place so users can check them whenever they want.

# Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to create a very simple console-based Python application where users can add their medicines, view the full timetable, update details, and delete medicines if needed. This app does not show reminders — it only helps users keep their medicine information organized.

# Objectives

• To allow users to add medicines with name,     time, and dosage.

• To display all medicines in an easy-to-read timetable.

• To provide options to update or delete any medicine.

• To create a beginner-friendly Python project using loops, lists, and basic input/output.

• Add medicine

• View medicine timetable

• Update medicine details

• Delete medicine

• Exit the program


~ This project does not include:
