# Medicine Timetable App

# 💫Introduction

This is a simple Python project I made to manage medicine timings. Many people forget their medicine schedules, so this app helps by storing medicines with their time and dosage.
It is a basic menu-driven program and does not give reminders — it only shows the timetable when the user wants to check it.

# ✨Features

• Add medicine (name, time, dosage).

• View the complete medicine timetable.

• Update any medicine details.

• Delete any medicine.

• Simple and easy-to-use console interface.

# 🛠️ How the App Works

1. The user runs the program.


2. A menu with five options appears:

• Add Medicine

• View Timetable

• Update Medicine

• Delete Medicine

• Exit



3. All medicines are stored in a list as dictionaries.


4. The user can update or delete any item using its number from the list.


5. The program continues running until the user chooses “Exit”.

# 📂 Technologies Used

• Python.

• Lists for storing multiple medicines.

• Dictionaries for storing medicine details.

• Conditional Statements.

• While loop and menu-driven structure.


# 🧠 Purpose of the Project

I made this project to practice:

• List handling

• Dictionaries

• Loops

• Conditional Statements 

• Interactive console apps


It also solves the simple problem of keeping medicine schedules organized.


# 🔮 Future Improvements

• Adding reminder or alarm system.

• Saving data to a file so it does not get erased after closing the program.

• Making a GUI version.

# 📌 Note

This app does not include reminders.
It is only for storing and viewing the timetable manually.
