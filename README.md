# Medicine_Timetable_App

This is a simple Python project I made to help manage daily medicines.

The app lets you add medicines, view your timetable, update any details, and delete medicines easily.

It runs in the terminal and is beginner-friendly.

# Features...

•	Add new medicines.

•	View all medicines in a timetable.

•	Update medicine name, time, or dosage.

•	Delete medicines.

•	Simple menu-based interface.

# How to Run...

1. Install Python on your system.
2. Save the code in a file like Medicine_Timetable_App.py
3. Run it using:
              python Medicine_Timetable_App.py

# Why I Made This Project...

I wanted to practice Python basics like lists, loops, conditional statements and menu-driven programs.

This project helped me understand how to store and manage data without using files or databases.

# Future Improvements...
•	Adding reminder notifications.

•	Saving data permanently in a file.

•	Making a GUI version.
